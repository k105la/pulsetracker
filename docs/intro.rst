**pulsetracker** is an open source tool built for monitoring heart rate.
The goal here is to have a low cost and widely accessible way to measure someones heart rate.
It uses a touch-based system for generating heart rate values. 
In contrast to it's counterpart(touchless-based systems) it is 
a far more accurate and less sensitive to enviornmental conditions.

Why was pulsetracker developed?
-------------------------------

After an exhaustive search for a simple library to do touch based
heart rate analysis. We found that the majority of code was writing
for touchless based system and some touch based systems as well. 
However, a well documented and simple to use API was not found.
So we decided to develop pulsetracker to fill this void.
