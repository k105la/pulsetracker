## ðŸ’­ Background
pulsetracker is an open source tool built for monitoring heart rate. The goal here is to have a low cost and widely accessible way to measure someones heart rate. It uses a touch-based system for generating heart rate values. In contrast to it's counterpart(touchless-based systems) it is a far more accurate and less sensitive to enviornmental conditions.
